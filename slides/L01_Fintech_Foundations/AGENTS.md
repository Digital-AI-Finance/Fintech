# L01: Fintech Foundations and Overview

<!-- Parent: ../AGENTS.md -->

## Content Summary

**Lecture 1** introduces the fundamentals of financial technology through a comprehensive examination of what fintech is, its historical evolution, the disruption of traditional banking value chains, and the emerging collaboration models between incumbents and startups. The lecture culminates in embedded finance architecture and positioning fintech within the broader financial services ecosystem.

**Learning arc:** WHY (disruption tension) > WHAT (definition and evolution) > HOW (collaboration models) > WHERE (embedded finance) > SO WHAT (strategic implications)

### Key Topics

1. **What is Fintech?** — Definition, characteristics, and scope within financial services
2. **Historical Evolution** — From early electronic banking (1950s) through digital banking to modern embedded finance
3. **2008 Financial Crisis as Catalyst** — How regulatory distrust and technological opportunity converged
4. **Banking Value Chain Disruption** — Unbundling of traditional banking functions across payments, lending, wealth management, and insurance
5. **Collaboration Models** — Partnerships, licensing, acquisitions, APIs, and white-label relationships
6. **Competitive Advantages** — Speed, cost, regulatory agility vs. scale, trust, and legacy systems
7. **Embedded Finance Architecture** — How fintech features are embedded into non-financial platforms (e.g., "buy now, pay later")

## AI Agent Instructions

### For Slides (LaTeX) Work

**When updating, generating, or debugging L01 slide decks:**

1. **Understand the variant system:**
   - `L01_full.tex`, `L01_overview.tex`, `L01_deepdive.tex` all use `\input{../../_shared/preamble.tex}` — centralizes theme, colors, and shared commands
   - `L01_core.tex`, `L01_mini10.tex`, `L01_mini5.tex` are self-contained — include all preamble, color definitions, and custom commands inline

2. **Frame structure convention:**
   - Frames are grouped by narrative role (WHY, WHAT, HOW, WHERE, SO WHAT)
   - Comments mark role boundaries and frame indices
   - Use `\bottomnote{}` for pedagogical guidance on assessments

3. **Figure inclusion:**
   - All figures are in `[N]_*/chart.pdf` or `cartoon.pdf` (generated by Python scripts, flat in lecture dir)
   - Use `\includegraphics[width=...]` with PDF paths relative to the lecture directory
   - Full/overview/deepdive variants include all 12 figures; core/mini variants may embed inline TikZ instead

4. **Compilation:**
   - Full/overview/deepdive: Requires `_shared/preamble.tex` via `\input{../../_shared/preamble.tex}`
   - Core/mini5/mini10: Self-contained; compile with `pdflatex L01_*.tex` directly
   - All use `beamer` document class, `Madrid` theme, `whale` color theme

5. **Assessment alignment:**
   - Learning objectives (Frame 3) map to Bloom's levels: Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate
   - Quiz and exercise assessments reference these objectives
   - Update objectives if changing learning goals

### For Figures (Python) Work

**When updating, generating, or debugging charts and cartoons:**

1. **Standard chart structure:**
   - Each subdirectory contains one Python script (`chart.py` or `cartoon.py`) and one generated PDF
   - All scripts import from `_shared/chart_styles.py` via `sys.path.insert(0, ...)`
   - Charts use `CHART_METADATA` dictionary with keys: `title`, `type`, `section` (WHY/WHAT/HOW/WHERE/SO WHAT), `lecture_number`

2. **Chart types in L01:**
   - **Time series** (01 evolution timeline): S-curve with annotated milestones
   - **Diagram** (02 value chain, 07 flows, 08 embedded architecture): Network or structural layout
   - **Matrix** (03 collaboration models, 09 impact comparison, 10 concepts): Comparison tables or grids
   - **Growth chart** (05 recession, 06 investment): Trend lines with annotations
   - **Cartoon** (11 opening, 12 closing): XKCD-style stick figures, speech bubbles, captions

3. **Color palette:**
   - Use `V4_COLORS` from `_shared/chart_styles.py`: `MLPURPLE`, `MLBLUE`, `MLRED`, `MLORANGE`, `MLGREEN`, `MLGRAY`, `MLTEAL`, `MLCYAN`, `MLYELLOW`, `MLPINK`, `MLBROWN`
   - Falls back to hardcoded hex if import fails

4. **Function imports:**
   - `apply_v4_style(ax, title='', xlabel='', ylabel='')` — formats axes (removes top/right spines, sets colors)
   - `save_chart(fig, filename='chart.pdf', dpi=300)` — saves as PDF with standard DPI

5. **Execution:**
   - Run: `python chart.py` or `python cartoon.py` in the subdirectory
   - Generates `chart.pdf` or `cartoon.pdf` in the same location
   - All scripts use `matplotlib.use('Agg')` for headless rendering

6. **Fallback handling:**
   - All scripts include try/except around chart_styles import
   - Hardcoded V4_COLORS dict and standalone function definitions ensure script runs even if import fails
   - Good for testing and debugging in isolation

### For Quizzes

**When authoring or updating assessments:**

1. **Quiz alignment:**
   - Question types should map to Bloom's levels from objectives: Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate
   - Main quiz content lives in the `docs/quiz/` folder
   - Use terminology consistently with slides

2. **Assessment scenarios:**
   - Timeline milestones (when did X disrupt Y?)
   - Partnership model selection (which model fits scenario Z?)
   - Impact analysis (how would embedded finance affect a given platform?)

## Dependencies

- **Parent:** `../AGENTS.md` (slides directory documentation)
- **Shared preamble:** `../../_shared/preamble.tex` (theme, colors, macros for full/overview/deepdive variants)
- **Shared chart styles:** `../../_shared/chart_styles.py` (color palette and formatting functions)
- **Dependencies within subdirectories:**
  - Each chart subdirectory is independent; can regenerate any chart.pdf by running its chart.py
