\begin{frame}{What Makes This Deep Dive Different}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
      \textbf{This variant goes beyond the standard lecture:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Collaboration economics:} when each model creates vs.\ destroys value -- not just what models exist
        \item \textbf{Regulatory theory:} why mandated API access was a rational policy response, not just what PSD2 says
        \item \textbf{Unit economics:} CAC, LTV, churn -- the numbers that determine which fintechs survive
        \item \textbf{Historical parallels:} telegraph, telephone, internet as prior waves; what the pattern predicts for fintech
        \item \textbf{Game theory:} the strategic logic behind bank-fintech relationship choices
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.42\textwidth}
      \begin{block}{Assumed Background}
        You are familiar with: DCF, risk-adjusted returns, regulatory frameworks, financial intermediation theory. This session applies those lenses to fintech strategy.

\begin{frame}{Collaboration Model Economics I: The Value Creation Logic}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.52\textwidth}
      \begin{block}{Why Do Partnerships Exist at All?}
        Standard transaction cost theory (Coase, Williamson): a firm boundary exists when internal coordination costs are lower than market transaction costs. Bank-fintech partnerships form when \emph{neither party} can replicate the other's asset faster than the cost of partnering.
      \end{block}
      \vspace{0.4em}
      \textbf{Bank's non-replicable assets:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Regulatory charter (years to obtain)
        \item Depositor trust capital (cannot be purchased)
        \item Balance sheet / cost of funds advantage
        \item Existing compliance infrastructure
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
      \textbf{Fintech's non-replicable assets:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Speed-to-market culture (flat hierarchy)
        \item User experience IP (redesigning from zero)
        \item Proprietary data models (alternative credit scoring)
        \item Developer talent ($\neq$ bank talent)
      \end{itemize}
      \vspace{0.4em}
      \begin{exampleblock}{Value Creation Condition}
        A partnership \textbf{creates} value when: \\[0.3em]
        $\text{Joint surplus} > \text{Sum of standalone values}$ \\[0.3em]
        i.e., the bank could not build the UX in 3 years, and the fintech could not obtain the license in 3 years.

  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
      \textbf{\textcolor{mlred}{Value Destruction Conditions:}}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Partnership:} destroys value when bank imposes procurement cycles on agile product decisions -- the fintech's speed advantage evaporates
        \item \textit{Acquisition:} destroys value when the acquired team departs post-earnout; the bank paid for people, not just code
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{White-label/BaaS:} destroys value when the fintech layer commoditises -- multiple fintechs on the same BaaS provider compete on price alone; infrastructure rents collapse
        \item \textit{Open banking:} destroys value for the bank when data sharing benefits third parties without compensating traffic; the bank becomes a dumb pipe
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.76\textwidth]{02_banking_value_chain_disruption/chart.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \vspace{-0.2em}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
      \textbf{The cycle has three phases:}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Unbundling (2010--2017):} startups attack single high-margin layers (payments, lending UX, FX remittance). Each startup is more focused and cheaper than the bank at that layer.
        \item \textbf{Scale pressure (2018--2022):} standalone CAC is unsustainable. A payments app needs to cross-sell to cover acquisition costs.
        \item \textbf{Rebundling (2022--present):} successful fintechs add adjacent products -- neobanks add loans, insurtech, investments. They recreate the bundle they disrupted.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.42\textwidth}
      \begin{alertblock}{The Strategic Implication}
        Incumbent banks that survive unbundling long enough face a \emph{rebundled} fintech competitor with both UX advantage AND product breadth. The window for partnership is before rebundling completes.

% --- REGULATORY THEORY OF OPEN BANKING ---

\begin{frame}{Regulatory Theory I: Why Did Regulators Mandate API Access?}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
      \textbf{The Information Asymmetry Argument:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Banks hold transaction histories that are the single richest data asset for assessing creditworthiness, spending behaviour, and financial risk
        \item This creates a \textbf{data moat}: the incumbent's information advantage is a structural barrier to entry -- not a legitimate product innovation
        \item A new lender cannot price credit competitively without transaction history; a bank can withhold it as a retention tool
      \end{itemize}
      \vspace{0.4em}
      \begin{block}{The Policy Logic}
        If data concentration creates market power, and market power is not the result of superior product quality, then mandating data portability is equivalent to breaking up a monopoly -- the ``data antitrust'' argument.
      \end{block}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.42\textwidth}
      \textbf{Three Regulatory Justifications:}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textit{Consumer sovereignty:} data about a consumer should be portable by that consumer (GDPR logic extended to financial data)
        \item \textit{Competition policy:} reduce structural barriers to entry in financial services
        \item \textit{Innovation externality:} third-party developers will build services on open data that incumbent banks have no incentive to build themselves
      \end{enumerate}
      \vspace{0.4em}
      \begin{alertblock}{The Counter-argument}
        Mandatory data sharing reduces the incentive for banks to invest in data infrastructure -- if the output is free to competitors, the ROI on collection collapses.
      \end{alertblock}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}
  \bottomnote{The EU's PSD2 (2018) rests primarily on the consumer sovereignty and competition policy justifications. See Recital 27, PSD2 Directive 2015/2366/EU.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Regulatory Theory II: Open Banking Models and Systemic Trade-offs}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.52\textwidth}
      \textbf{Mandate Design Choices:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Scope:} current accounts only (UK/EU) vs.\ all financial products (Australia's CDR) vs.\ all sectors (India's Account Aggregator). Broader scope creates more value but more systemic risk
        \item \textit{Consent model:} bank-mediated vs.\ consumer direct. EU GDPR requires explicit consent per use case -- creates friction
        \item \textit{Liability allocation:} who is responsible when an authorised third party misuses data? PSD2 places liability on the TPP; US frameworks are unclear
        \item \textit{API standardisation:} voluntary (US, Germany) vs.\ mandated standard (UK Open Banking Standard). Voluntary produces fragmentation
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
      \begin{exampleblock}{Systemic Risk Introduced}
        Open banking creates API interdependence. A data breach at a large AISP (Account Information Service Provider) exposes data from \emph{hundreds of banks simultaneously} -- a new systemic risk vector that did not exist under siloed banking.
      \end{exampleblock}
      \vspace{0.4em}
      \textbf{Empirical evidence:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item UK Open Banking: 7+ million users by 2023, but concentration in large fintechs (Plaid-equivalent providers)
        \item Brazil's PIX: fastest open payments adoption globally -- but achieved via payment infrastructure mandate, not data mandate
        \item India AA: high adoption in lending; slow in wealth management -- consent fatigue

% --- FINTECH UNIT ECONOMICS ---

\begin{frame}{Fintech Unit Economics I: The CAC/LTV Framework}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.50\textwidth}
      \begin{block}{The Two Metrics That Determine Survival}
        \textbf{Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):}
        \[ \text{CAC} = \frac{\text{Sales + Marketing Spend}}{\text{New Customers Acquired}} \]
        \textbf{Lifetime Value (LTV):}
        \[ \text{LTV} = \frac{\text{ARPU} \times \text{Gross Margin}}{\text{Churn Rate}} \]
        \textbf{Viability condition:} $\text{LTV} / \text{CAC} \geq 3$ (venture-capital benchmark) and payback period $\leq 12$ months for consumer fintech.
      \end{block}
      \vspace{0.3em}
      \textbf{The neobank problem:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Free current accounts: ARPU $\approx$ \pounds10-30/year
        \item Mobile-first CAC $\approx$ \pounds30-100 via paid social
        \item LTV/CAC $< 1$ without cross-sell
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.47\textwidth}
      \textbf{Why churn rate dominates LTV:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item At 5\% monthly churn: avg.\ customer life = 20 months
        \item At 2\% monthly churn: avg.\ customer life = 50 months
        \item A 3 percentage point improvement in retention has larger LTV impact than doubling ARPU
      \end{itemize}
      \vspace{0.3em}
      \begin{alertblock}{The Cross-Sell Imperative}
        Every fintech with a payments or account product is using it as an \emph{acquisition loss leader}. The business model only works if the company can cross-sell lending, insurance, or investment products at much higher margins. This is why all neobanks eventually look like banks.
      \end{alertblock}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}
  \bottomnote{LTV/CAC benchmarks: SaaS Capital (2023); Andreessen Horowitz fintech benchmarks. For neobank unit economics, see Starling Bank 2022/23 Annual Report (first profitable neobank in UK).}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fintech Unit Economics II: The Path to Profitability}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
      \textbf{Three Structural Routes to Profitability:}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Scale through lending:} move into credit products (BNPL, personal loans, SME lending). Net interest margin 3--8\% replaces interchange revenue. Requires either a banking licence or BaaS partnership. Risk: credit losses in downturns (2022--23 BNPL deterioration)
        \item \textbf{B2B pivot:} sell the technology stack built for consumers to enterprises. Marqeta, Stripe, Adyen succeeded here. B2B SaaS economics are far superior: lower churn, higher ACV, shorter sales cycle at scale
        \item \textbf{Data monetisation:} aggregate anonymised transaction data and sell insights to retailers, asset managers, advertisers. High margin, no incremental cost. Regulatory risk: GDPR/CCPA limits monetisation scope
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.42\textwidth}
      \begin{block}{Valuation Implication}
        Fintech valuations depend critically on \emph{which} profitability route investors believe in:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Lending route $\Rightarrow$ valued as a bank (P/B multiple, credit quality scrutiny)
          \item B2B/SaaS route $\Rightarrow$ valued as software (revenue multiple, NRR focus)
          \item Data route $\Rightarrow$ valued as a platform (GMV/DAU metrics)
        \end{itemize}
        Misalignment between narrative and unit economics is a leading indicator of valuation collapse.
      \end{block}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}
  \bottomnote{The 2021--2022 fintech valuation reset was driven by rate rises compressing lending margins \emph{and} multiple compression as fintech stocks were reclassified from tech to financial multiples.}

      \end{center}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.42\textwidth}
      \textbf{The Repeating Pattern:}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Telegraph (1840s--1890s):} enabled commodity arbitrage across exchanges; collapsed local information monopolies of trading houses. Analogue: fintech's API economy collapsing data monopolies.
        \item \textbf{Telephone (1900s--1940s):} disintermediated physical brokers for simple transactions; created the first remote banking relationships. Analogue: neobanks disintermediating branch networks.
        \item \textbf{Mainframe + ATMs (1960s--1980s):} transferred processing from human tellers to machines; banks that adopted early gained scale advantages. Analogue: cloud-native banks vs.\ legacy mainframe incumbents.
        \item \textbf{Internet (1995--2008):} lowered distribution costs to near-zero; created online brokerages and P2P lending. Analogue: mobile-first fintech and embedded distribution.

    \end{column}
  \end{columns}
  \bottomnote{Perez (2002) ``Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital'' provides the canonical framework for technology-finance co-evolution across all four waves.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What History Predicts: The Consolidation Phase}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
      \textbf{Carlota Perez's Technology Surge Model:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Installation phase:} new infrastructure deployed; financial speculation; many entrants; incumbents threatened but not yet displaced
        \item \textbf{Turning point:} financial crisis (or rate shock) eliminates weak entrants; capital dries up; survivor bias reveals true product-market fit
        \item \textbf{Deployment phase:} surviving technologies permeate the economy; incumbents either adopt or die; regulation catches up
      \end{itemize}
      \vspace{0.4em}
      \begin{block}{Where Is Fintech Now?}
        The 2021 peak and 2022--23 correction follow Perez's pattern precisely: a speculative installation phase ended by rate shock. We are likely at the beginning of the deployment phase -- meaning consolidation, not continued fragmentation.
      \end{block}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.42\textwidth}
      \begin{alertblock}{Strategic Prediction}
        In each previous wave:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The number of providers \emph{collapsed} by 80\%+ from peak
          \item The infrastructure layer became a regulated utility (telcos, payment networks)
          \item The application layer on top remained competitive and innovative
          \item Incumbents who survived partnered with infrastructure rather than trying to own it
        \end{itemize}
      \end{alertblock}
      \vspace{0.3em}
      Prediction: \textbf{BaaS/embedded finance infrastructure} will consolidate to 3--5 global providers; application-layer fintechs will remain numerous but will rent infrastructure rather than own it.

    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.43\textwidth}
      \textbf{The Repeated Game Structure:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Bank and fintech face a classic \textbf{Stag Hunt} dynamic: cooperate for large mutual gain, but each can defect for smaller certain gain
        \item \textit{Bank's defection option:} build in-house once the fintech demonstrates product-market fit (free-ride on fintech's R\&D)
        \item \textit{Fintech's defection option:} obtain a banking licence once the customer base justifies the cost (disintermediate the bank partner)
      \end{itemize}
      \vspace{0.3em}
      \begin{block}{Sustaining Cooperation}
        Cooperation is sustained when: (i) the shadow of the future is long (repeat interactions), (ii) reputation effects are strong (fintech ecosystem is small; defection is visible), and (iii) contractual earnouts and revenue shares are properly structured to align incentives.

\begin{frame}{Synthesis: Implications for Financial Strategy}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
      \textbf{For Incumbent Banks:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The unbundling-rebundling cycle means the competitive threat \emph{intensifies over time}, not diminishes. Mature fintechs are more dangerous than early-stage ones
        \item Opt for partnerships early (before rebundling), acquisitions of pre-scale fintechs (before they obtain licences), and open banking compliance as a platform play rather than a compliance burden
        \item Unit economics analysis of partner fintechs should precede strategic commitment: a partner with LTV/CAC $<$ 1 will eventually be acquired, pivot, or fail -- none of which is predictable or contractually manageable
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.42\textwidth}
      \textbf{For Fintech Founders/Investors:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The path to profitability must be articulated at Series A, not IPO. Investors who funded on growth metrics alone mispriced the 2020--21 cohort
        \item Regulatory positioning is existential: a fintech without a licence or a licensed BaaS partner is one enforcement action away from shutdown
        \item Historical consolidation pattern suggests: be the infrastructure (durable, recurring revenue, high switching costs) rather than the application (competitive, low switching costs, subject to commoditisation)

      \textbf{Three Major Definitional Frameworks:}

      \textbf{Arner, Barberis \& Buckley (2016):}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item FinTech = ``technology-enabled financial innovation that is giving rise to new business models, applications, processes, and products with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services''
        \item Historical scope: includes 1860s telegraph-based bond trading; fintech is not new
        \item Three eras: FinTech 1.0 (infrastructure), 2.0 (digitalisation), 3.0 (democratisation)
      \end{itemize}

      \vspace{0.3em}
      \textbf{FSB (Financial Stability Board, 2017):}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item ``Technologically enabled innovation in financial services that could result in new business models, applications, processes, or products with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services''
        \item Note: near-identical to Arner -- FSB adopted the academic definition
        \item Emphasis: \emph{material effect} -- excludes incremental IT upgrades
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
      \textbf{BIS (2018, CGFS-FSB Working Group):}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Adds: ``the range of new technologies that have the potential to transform the provision of financial services, spurring the development of new business models, applications, processes, and products''
        \item Distinction: BIS focuses on \emph{technology categories} (AI, DLT, cloud, APIs, big data) rather than outcomes
      \end{itemize}
      \vspace{0.3em}
      \begin{alertblock}{Why the Debate Matters}
        If fintech = any technology-enabled innovation (Arner/FSB), then it includes incumbent banks' internal IT. If fintech = new entrants using tech (industry usage), then incumbents are excluded. This distinction determines regulatory perimeter, market share statistics, and policy responses.

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Terminal value dominates (70--90\% of DCF value) due to near-zero near-term FCF
        \item Discount rate controversy: WACC using a pure fintech beta (high) vs.\ financial services beta (medium) vs.\ tech beta (low) produces dramatically different valuations
        \item Growth rate assumptions: most fintech DCFs assume growth convergence to market average within 10 years -- the historical evidence from tech suggests this understates both growth and competitive obsolescence
      \end{itemize}

      \begin{alertblock}{Practitioner Caution}
        No single valuation framework works across the fintech lifecycle. Applying a bank's P/B framework to a pre-profit neobank, or a SaaS revenue multiple to a lending-dependent fintech, are both category errors with material economic consequences.
