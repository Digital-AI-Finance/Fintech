      Welcome to Financial Technology.

      \vspace{0.5em}
      This course examines how technology is transforming every corner of
      financial services --- from payments and lending to insurance and wealth
      management.

      \vspace{0.5em}
      This first lecture establishes the foundation:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item What fintech \textbf{is}
        \item Where it \textbf{came from}
        \item Where it is \textbf{going}

\begin{frame}{The Fintech in Your Pocket}
  Think about the last 48 hours.

  \vspace{0.5em}
  How many financial transactions did you make? How many involved a traditional
  bank branch? Now open your phone --- how many apps touch your money? Banking,
  payments, investment, insurance? \textcolor{mlpurple}{Each one is a fintech story.}

  \vspace{0.8em}
  \begin{exampleblock}{Quick Exercise}
    Count the financial apps on your phone. For each, ask:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Is this from a \textbf{traditional bank}, a \textbf{fintech startup},
            or a \textbf{big tech company}?
    \end{itemize}
    Bring your count to the discussion.

    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Insurance (Insurtech)}} --- on-demand, parametric, automated claims
    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Wealth Management}} --- robo-advisors, micro-investing, social trading
    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Capital Markets}} --- algorithmic trading, tokenization, crowdfunding
    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{RegTech}} --- compliance automation, identity verification, monitoring

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{What you see:} Major fintech milestones from the 1950s to the
          2020s --- credit cards, ATMs, online banking, mobile payments,
          blockchain, embedded finance.
    \item \textbf{Key pattern:} The pace of innovation \textit{accelerates}. The
          gap between credit cards and ATMs was a decade; between mobile payments
          and blockchain, just years.
    \item \textbf{Takeaway:} Each wave builds on the infrastructure of the
          previous one.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{What you see:} The traditional bank as a vertically integrated
          institution vs.\ specialized fintechs attacking each layer.
    \item \textbf{Key pattern:} Fintech does not replace the bank. It
          \textit{unbundles} it --- each startup attacks the most profitable or
          most inefficient piece.
    \item \textbf{Takeaway:} The question is not ``Will banks disappear?'' but
          ``Which parts of banking can survive unbundling?''
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Before 2008 --- The Trust Assumption}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.50\textwidth}
      Before the crisis, the banking landscape was stable and predictable:

      \vspace{0.5em}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item High trust in institutions
        \item Limited alternatives for consumers
        \item Regulatory frameworks designed for incumbents
        \item Innovation happened \textit{inside} banks, not outside
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.47\textwidth}
      \vspace{0.5em}
      Banks were the only game in town. Consumers trusted them by default.
      Regulation protected them from competition. Innovation meant a new
      savings product, not a new business model.

      \vspace{0.5em}
      \begin{alertblock}{Key Insight}
        Trust in banks was not earned --- it was \textbf{assumed}. The crisis
        exposed the assumption.
      \end{alertblock}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{What you see:} A causal chain from the housing bubble to the
          opening of space for fintech entrants.
    \item \textbf{Key pattern:} Each step reduced a barrier to fintech entry.
          Trust erosion created \textit{demand}. Regulatory response created
          \textit{opportunity}. Unemployment created \textit{talent supply}.
    \item \textbf{Takeaway:} The 2008 crisis did not cause fintech, but it
          \textcolor{mlpurple}{removed the barriers} that had held it back for
          decades.

      \begin{block}{Regulatory Response}
        Post-crisis regulation (Dodd-Frank, PSD2, Open Banking) inadvertently
        created space for non-bank competitors.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{What you see:} Four models for how banks and fintechs work
          together, scored across five dimensions.
    \item \textbf{Key pattern:} No single model dominates. Partnerships offer
          speed but less control. Acquisitions offer control but are expensive
          and slow.
    \item \textbf{Takeaway:} The ``right'' model depends on the bank's strategic
          priorities and the fintech's maturity.

      Key regulations:

  \begin{enumerate}

          adequate licenses; crossing jurisdictional boundaries without
          authorization.
    \item \textcolor{mlred}{\textbf{Trust risk}} --- Data breaches; lack of
          deposit insurance; unclear complaint resolution pathways.
    \item \textcolor{mlred}{\textbf{Scalability risk}} --- Customer acquisition
          costs exceed lifetime value; unit economics never work at scale.
    \item \textcolor{mlred}{\textbf{Systemic risk}} --- Fintech becomes ``too
          connected to fail''; concentration in a small number of cloud
          providers.
  \end{enumerate}

    \item Will fintech \textbf{replace} institutions or \textbf{strengthen} them?

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Fintech defined:} Technology-enabled innovation that creates
          new financial products, processes, or business models.
    \item \textbf{Historical arc:} From credit cards (1950s) through online
          banking (1990s) to embedded finance (2020s) --- each wave built on the
          last.
    \item \textbf{Crisis catalyst:} The 2008 financial crisis eroded trust,
          opened regulatory space, and released talent --- creating the
          conditions for fintech's explosive growth.
    \item \textbf{Unbundling:} Fintech companies attack specific layers of the
          banking value chain, not the entire bank.
    \item \textbf{Collaboration spectrum:} Banks and fintechs interact through
          partnership, acquisition, white-label, and open banking --- each with
          distinct trade-offs.
    \item \textbf{Global variation:} Fintech adoption is highest where
          traditional banking infrastructure is weakest (the leapfrog effect).
    \item \textbf{Evaluation tool:} Five questions (customer, value chain,
          revenue model, regulatory position, value creation) reveal any
          fintech's true strategy.

% --- Frame 31: Summary / Next Lesson ---
\begin{frame}{Summary and Key Vocabulary}
  \textbf{Summary:} Fintech is the application of technology to financial
  services, driven by the convergence of eroded trust, enabling technology, and
  regulatory change after 2008. Traditional banks and fintech companies are
  increasingly choosing \textcolor{mlpurple}{collaboration over competition},
  through models ranging from partnerships to open banking APIs. The key question
  is not \textit{whether} fintech will transform finance, but
  \textit{how} the benefits and risks will be distributed across stakeholders.
