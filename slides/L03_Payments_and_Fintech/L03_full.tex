\begin{frame}{Bridge from Lecture~2}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
      In Lecture~2 we explored the \textbf{behavioral} side of fintech:
      trust, nudging, choice architecture, and the inclusion-protection
      trade-off.

      \vspace{0.5em}
      Now we apply that lens to the largest fintech vertical:
      \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{payments}}.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Choice architecture:} Every payment interface shapes
              spending behavior --- tap-to-pay removes the ``pain of paying.''
        \item \textbf{Trust:} Consumers entrust payment providers with every
              transaction. Trust failure here is existential.
        \item \textbf{Inclusion:} Real-time payment rails (UPI, PIX) are the
              most powerful inclusion infrastructure ever built.
      \end{itemize}

      \vspace{0.3em}

% --- Frame 5: The Pain of Paying ---
\begin{frame}{The Pain of Paying}
  Think about the last time you paid for something expensive with
  \textbf{cash} --- peeling off banknotes, watching your wallet thin. Now
  compare that to tapping your phone. \textcolor{mlpurple}{The amount was
  the same. The pain was not.}

  \vspace{0.5em}
  Behavioral economists call this the \textbf{pain of paying} --- the
  negative affect experienced at the moment of parting with money. Research
  by Prelec and Loewenstein (1998) established that payment pain is a
  function of three factors:

  \vspace{0.3em}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Salience:} Cash is tangible; digital payments are abstract.
          Less salience means less pain.
    \item \textbf{Temporal coupling:} When payment and consumption are
          simultaneous, pain is highest. Credit cards decouple them.
    \item \textbf{Form of payment:} Physical currency activates loss aversion
          more strongly than electronic transfers.
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.3em}
  \begin{exampleblock}{Quick Exercise}
    Check your last week of transactions. How many were cash? How many were
    contactless? Did you feel differently about spending in each mode?
  \end{exampleblock}
  \bottomnote{Prelec and Loewenstein (1998) and Soman (2003) show that credit card spending exceeds cash spending by 12--18\% for identical purchase decisions.}

% --- Frame 6: A Brief History of Payments ---
\begin{frame}{A Brief History of Payments}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Barter}} (pre-3000 BCE) --- Direct
          exchange of goods. Requires double coincidence of wants. Fundamentally
          unscalable.
    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Commodity money and coinage}}
          (c.~600 BCE) --- Lydian electrum coins standardized value.
          Portability and divisibility enabled trade at distance.
    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Paper money}} (c.~1000 CE, Song Dynasty)
          --- Promissory notes replaced heavy metal. Trust shifted from
          intrinsic value to issuer credibility.
    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Checks and wire transfers}}
          (17th--19th century) --- The Bank of England (1694) and the telegraph
          (1872, Western Union) enabled non-physical value transfer.
    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Payment cards}} (1950, Diners Club) ---
          Intermediated credit at point of sale. Created the multi-party model
          that still dominates.
    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Digital and mobile payments}}
          (2007--present) --- M-Pesa, Apple Pay, UPI, PIX. From plastic to
          software. From batch to real-time.
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.3em}
  \begin{block}{The Pattern}
    Each transition increased abstraction, reduced friction, and shifted trust
    from the medium to the \textcolor{mlpurple}{institution behind it}.

      \vspace{0.4em}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{China:} Mobile payments (Alipay, WeChat Pay) dominate
              at over 85\% of consumer transactions. Cards were leapfrogged
              entirely.
        \item \textbf{Nordics:} Card and mobile payments exceed 95\% of
              retail volume. Cash infrastructure is actively being
              dismantled.
        \item \textbf{Germany \& Japan:} Cash remains king at 50--60\% of
              point-of-sale transactions despite high wealth and connectivity.
        \item \textbf{Sub-Saharan Africa:} Mobile money (M-Pesa model)
              serves populations with no card infrastructure.
        \item \textbf{India:} UPI processed over 12~billion transactions per
              month by late 2024, a government-driven revolution.

              Over 400~million users.
        \item \textbf{PIX} (Brazil, 2020) --- Central bank mandated.
              Reached 150~million users in under two years. Free for
              individuals.
        \item \textbf{FedNow} (USA, 2023) --- The Federal Reserve's
              instant payment rail. Late entrant in a card-dominated market.
        \item \textbf{Faster Payments} (UK, 2008) --- Pioneer of 24/7
              settlement. Fifteen years of operational history.
        \item \textbf{SEPA Instant} (EU, 2017) --- Pan-European instant
              credit transfers. Adoption still uneven across member states.

% --- Frame 9: Why Cash Persists ---
\begin{frame}{Why Cash Persists}
  Despite the digital transition, cash remains the dominant payment method in
  most economies by transaction count. Four forces sustain it:

  \vspace{0.5em}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Anonymity and privacy}} --- Cash
          leaves no digital trail. In an era of surveillance capitalism, this
          is a feature, not a bug. Approximately 25\% of Europeans cite
          privacy as a primary reason for using cash (ECB, 2022).
    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Reliability}} --- Cash works without
          electricity, internet connectivity, or functioning servers. It is
          the payment method of last resort during outages and disasters.
    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Zero marginal cost}} --- No
          interchange fees, no processing charges, no terminal costs. For
          small merchants, cash is the cheapest payment method.
    \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Cultural and behavioral inertia}} ---
          Cash provides tangible budgeting (the ``envelope method''), visible
          spending limits, and a sense of control that digital payments lack.
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.3em}
  \begin{alertblock}{The Policy Tension}
    Eliminating cash without ensuring universal digital access creates a new
    form of \textcolor{mlred}{financial exclusion} --- one that
    disproportionately affects the elderly, rural populations, and the poor.
  \end{alertblock}

    \begin{column}{0.47\textwidth}
      The card payment ecosystem involves four principals:

      \vspace{0.4em}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Cardholder} --- The consumer who initiates the
              transaction.
        \item \textbf{Issuer} --- The cardholder's bank. Issues the card,
              extends credit or debit access, bears fraud risk.
        \item \textbf{Acquirer} --- The merchant's bank. Processes the
              transaction, deposits funds, manages merchant risk.
        \item \textbf{Network} (Visa, Mastercard) --- Sets rules, routes
              messages, guarantees interoperability. Does not hold funds.
      \end{itemize}

      \vspace{0.3em}
      \begin{block}{Key Insight}
        The network is a \textcolor{mlpurple}{two-sided platform}: it must

      Every card transaction passes through three stages:

      \vspace{0.4em}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Authorization}} (milliseconds) ---
              The issuer verifies the cardholder's identity, checks available
              funds or credit, and approves or declines. A hold is placed on
              the amount.
        \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Clearing}} (hours to one day) ---
              Transaction details are exchanged between acquirer and issuer
              via the network. Net positions are calculated.
        \item \textcolor{mlpurple}{\textbf{Settlement}} (one to three days) ---
              Actual funds transfer between issuer and acquirer banks. The
              merchant receives funds minus fees.
      \end{enumerate}

      \vspace{0.3em}

  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.50\textwidth}
      \textbf{Why does settlement still take days?}

      \vspace{0.5em}
      The card networks were designed in the 1960s--1970s for
      \textbf{batch processing}. Transactions are accumulated throughout the
      day and settled in bulk overnight. This architecture persists because:

      \vspace{0.4em}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Netting efficiency:} Batch settlement allows bilateral
              netting, reducing the total volume of interbank transfers by
              80--90\%.
        \item \textbf{Fraud windows:} The delay allows time for fraud
              detection, chargeback initiation, and dispute resolution.
        \item \textbf{Liquidity management:} Banks prefer predictable,
              scheduled settlement over continuous real-time obligations.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.47\textwidth}
      \textbf{The real-time alternative:}

      \vspace{0.5em}
      Systems like UPI and PIX settle in seconds. But real-time settlement
      requires:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Pre-funded accounts or central bank liquidity facilities
        \item Real-time fraud detection (no chargeback window)
        \item 24/7/365 operational infrastructure
        \item Irrevocability --- once settled, funds cannot be recalled
              through the system
      \end{itemize}

      \vspace{0.4em}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Correspondent banking:} Most cross-border payments
              traverse a chain of intermediary banks, each adding fees,
              delays, and opacity.
        \item \textbf{SWIFT:} A messaging network (not a settlement system).
              SWIFT carries payment instructions; actual settlement occurs
              through nostro/vostro account relationships.
        \item \textbf{FX conversion:} Each hop may involve a currency
              conversion with opaque markup, typically 1--4\% above
              mid-market rates.
        \item \textbf{Compliance layers:} AML/KYC checks at each
              intermediary add processing time (typically 2--5 business days

              funding (UPI is zero; Apple Pay passes through card fees).
        \item \textbf{BNPL:} 3--6\% merchant discount rate. The most
              expensive option, subsidized by the promise of higher
              conversion rates.

      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Economic rationale:} Compensates the issuer for fraud
              risk, interest-free period (credit cards), and the cost of
              maintaining the cardholder relationship.
        \item \textbf{Set by networks:} Visa and Mastercard publish
              interchange schedules with hundreds of rate categories based
              on card type, merchant category, and transaction method.
        \item \textbf{Not negotiable:} Individual merchants cannot negotiate
              interchange rates. They can only negotiate the acquirer's

      The traditional acquiring model requires each merchant to establish a

      \textbf{The PayFac economics:}

      \vspace{0.5em}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item PayFacs charge a flat rate (e.g., 2.9\% + \$0.30) regardless
              of card type. Simple, but often above cost.

      \vspace{0.4em}
      \begin{itemize}

              per transaction (plus a 1-cent fraud adjustment).

              of USD~6--8~billion.
        \item \textcolor{mlred}{Unintended:} Banks eliminated free checking
              accounts and debit rewards programs to recover lost revenue.
              Small banks (exempt from the cap) saw limited benefit as
              merchants routed to the cheapest network regardless.
        \item \textcolor{mlred}{Unintended:} Credit card interchange ---
              not covered by Durbin --- actually \textit{increased} as

  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
      Five questions to evaluate any payment system, method, or innovation:

      \vspace{0.4em}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Who bears the cost?}\\
              Is the cost visible to the payer, hidden in merchant prices,
              or subsidized by government?
        \item \textbf{What is the settlement finality?}\\
              When does the recipient have irrevocable access to funds?
              Minutes, hours, or days?
        \item \textbf{How does it handle failure?}\\
              What happens when the payment goes wrong? Who absorbs fraud
              losses, chargebacks, and errors?
        \item \textbf{Who is excluded?}\\
              What prerequisites does it require --- bank account,
              smartphone, identity documents, internet access?
        \item \textbf{What behavioral effects does it create?}\\
              Does it increase or decrease spending awareness? Does it
              nudge toward saving or consumption?
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.42\textwidth}
      \textbf{Applying the framework:}

      \vspace{0.4em}
      \begin{block}{Cash}
        Cost: payer. Finality: instant. Failure: bearer risk. Exclusion:
        none. Behavior: high spending awareness.
      \end{block}

      \vspace{0.3em}
      \begin{block}{Credit Card}
        Cost: merchant (interchange). Finality: T+1 to T+3. Failure:
        chargeback (consumer protected). Exclusion: credit score required.
        Behavior: reduced spending pain.
      \end{block}

      \vspace{0.3em}
      \begin{block}{UPI / PIX}
        Cost: government-subsidized. Finality: seconds. Failure: limited
        recourse. Exclusion: smartphone + bank account. Behavior: variable.
      \end{block}
    \end{column}

\begin{frame}{What Comes Next}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Next:} L04 (Fintech Security and Regulation --- RegTech) ---
          How regulators are responding to the payment innovations discussed
          today. AML/KYC automation, regulatory sandboxes, and the rise of
          supervisory technology.
    \item \textbf{Before L04, reflect:} Trace your last online purchase from
          tap to settlement. How many intermediaries touched your money? What
          did each one charge? Could the transaction have been routed more
          cheaply?
    \item \textbf{Workshop preparation:} Review the payment evaluation
          framework (Frame~27). You will use it to compare two payment systems
          in Workshop~D.
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.8em}
  \begin{block}{Why Regulation Matters}
    Every payment innovation discussed today --- real-time rails, stablecoins,
    CBDCs, embedded payments --- \textcolor{mlpurple}{exists within a regulatory
    framework that determines who can build it, who can use it, and who is
    protected when it fails}. L04 examines that framework.

% --- Frame 30: Key Takeaways ---
\begin{frame}{Key Takeaways}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Payment history is dematerialization:} Every transition ---
          from barter to coinage to paper to digital --- increased
          abstraction and shifted trust from the medium to the institution.
    \item \textbf{The four-party model:} Card payments flow through issuer,
          acquirer, network, and merchant. Understanding this chain is
          essential to understanding payment costs.
    \item \textbf{Settlement is not instant:} Authorization takes milliseconds,
          but traditional settlement takes days. Real-time systems (UPI, PIX)
          are closing this gap, with trade-offs.
    \item \textbf{Payment costs are regressive:} Small merchants pay the
          highest effective rates. Interchange is a hidden cross-subsidy from
          merchants to cardholders.
    \item \textbf{Cross-border payments remain broken:} Average remittance
          costs of 6.2\% represent a multi-billion-dollar tax on the world's
          poorest populations.
    \item \textbf{CBDCs force design choices:} Privacy vs.\ traceability,
          interest vs.\ non-interest, account-based vs.\ token-based. No
          single design satisfies all objectives.
    \item \textbf{Invisible payments remove friction:} Embedded payments
          maximize convenience but eliminate the behavioral friction that
          supports deliberate spending.
  \end{enumerate}

% --- Frame 31: Summary and Key Vocabulary ---
\begin{frame}{Summary and Key Vocabulary}
  \textbf{Summary:} Payment systems are the circulatory system of the
  financial economy --- and they are undergoing their most profound
  transformation since the invention of the credit card. Real-time domestic
  rails are replacing batch settlement, open banking is challenging card
  network dominance, and CBDCs and stablecoins are redefining what
  ``money'' means. Yet cross-border payments remain slow and expensive,
  interchange economics disproportionately burden small merchants, and the
  progressive \textcolor{mlpurple}{invisibility of payments} raises
  behavioral concerns about consumer spending control. The central lesson of
  L03 is that \textit{payment system design is not merely an engineering
  problem --- it is a policy choice that determines who pays, who profits,
  and who is excluded}.
